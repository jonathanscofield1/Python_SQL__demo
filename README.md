# Python_SQL__demo
Use Python to extract data from the public [MusicBrainze](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database) database and perform basic visualizations. The steps for this project are as follows:

1. Download a copy of the database from one of the mirrors listed on the website
2. Convert downloaded files to .txt files using terminal
3. Use provided schema to determine the contents of each file
4. Parse and load data from selected files to SQLite database (stored locally)
5. Query and visualize data from SQLite database

I ran the database builder from the terminal; however, I used a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for the visualization and provided three different file formats of the resulting visualizations.
